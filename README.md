### What is Sample Factory?

Sample Factory is one of the fastest RL libraries.
We focused on very efficient synchronous and asynchronous implementations of policy gradients (PPO). 

Sample Factory is thoroughly tested, used by many researchers and practitioners, and is actively maintained.
Our implementation is known to reach SOTA performance in a variety of domains in a short amount of time.
Clips below demonstrate ViZDoom, IsaacGym, DMLab-30, Megaverse, Mujoco, and Atari agents trained with Sample Factory:

**Key features:**

* Highly optimized algorithm [architecture](https://www.samplefactory.dev/06-architecture/overview/) for maximum learning throughput
* [Synchronous and asynchronous](https://www.samplefactory.dev/07-advanced-topics/sync-async/) training regimes
* [Serial (single-process) mode](https://www.samplefactory.dev/07-advanced-topics/serial-mode/) for easy debugging
* Optimal performance in both CPU-based and [GPU-accelerated environments](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/isaacgym/)
* Single- & multi-agent training, self-play, supports [training multiple policies](https://www.samplefactory.dev/07-advanced-topics/multi-policy-training/) at once on one or many GPUs
* Population-Based Training ([PBT](https://www.samplefactory.dev/07-advanced-topics/multi-policy-training/))
* Discrete, continuous, hybrid action spaces
* Vector-based, image-based, dictionary observation spaces
* Automatically creates a model architecture by parsing action/observation space specification. Supports [custom model architectures](https://www.samplefactory.dev/03-customization/custom-models/)
* Library is designed to be imported into other projects, [custom environments](https://www.samplefactory.dev/03-customization/custom-environments/) are first-class citizens
* Detailed [WandB and Tensorboard summaries](https://www.samplefactory.dev/05-monitoring/metrics-reference/), [custom metrics](https://www.samplefactory.dev/05-monitoring/custom-metrics/)
* [HuggingFace ðŸ¤— integration](https://www.samplefactory.dev/10-huggingface/huggingface/) (upload trained models and metrics to the Hub)
* [Multiple](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/mujoco/) [example](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/atari/) [environment](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/vizdoom/) [integrations](https://www.samplefactory.dev/09-environment-integrations/dmlab/) with tuned parameters and trained models

This Readme provides only a brief overview of the library.
Visit full documentation at [https://samplefactory.dev](https://samplefactory.dev) for more details.

## Installation

Just install from PyPI:

```pip install sample-factory```

SF is known to work on Linux and macOS. There is no Windows support at this time.
Please refer to the [documentation](https://samplefactory.dev) for additional environment-specific installation notes.

## Quickstart

Use command line to train an agent using one of the existing integrations, e.g. Mujoco (might need to run `pip install sample-factory[mujoco]`):

```bash
python -m sf_examples.mujoco.train_mujoco --env=mujoco_ant --experiment=Ant --train_dir=./train_dir
```

Stop the experiment (Ctrl+C) when the desired performance is reached and then evaluate the agent:

```bash
python -m sf_examples.mujoco.enjoy_mujoco --env=mujoco_ant --experiment=Ant --train_dir=./train_dir
```

Do the same in a pixel-based VizDoom environment (might need to run `pip install sample-factory[vizdoom]`, please also see docs for VizDoom-specific instructions):

```bash
python -m sf_examples.vizdoom.train_vizdoom --env=doom_basic --experiment=DoomBasic --train_dir=./train_dir --num_workers=16 --num_envs_per_worker=10 --train_for_env_steps=1000000
python -m sf_examples.vizdoom.enjoy_vizdoom --env=doom_basic --experiment=DoomBasic --train_dir=./train_dir
```

Monitor any running or completed experiment with Tensorboard:

```bash
tensorboard --logdir=./train_dir
```
(or see the docs for WandB integration).

To continue from here, copy and modify one of the existing env integrations to train agents in your own custom environment. We provide
examples for all kinds of supported environments, please refer to the [documentation](https://samplefactory.dev) for more details.
